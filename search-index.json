[{"content":"As rightly captioned, what\u0026rsquo;s the point ?\nI\u0026rsquo;m currently in my second year of an undergraduate LLB (Bachelor of Laws) degree. Do I want to be a lawyer, probably not ? What do I want to be ? I don\u0026rsquo;t know. All I know is I want to do something big, really big.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve always enjoyed the process of learning, teaching myself how to code a while back was the genesis for me. I would become soo engrossed in coding that I would gladly sit behind my computer for 12 hours a day. Now what was I doing?, I don\u0026rsquo;t know. What did I accomplish from that? I don\u0026rsquo;t know. But it changed me.\nIt felt great, almost like an adrenaline rush. I would spend two hours following a tutorial, trying to make a game with the new fancy game engine I just discovered. And then spend the next two trying to make sense of a linux kernel device driver book. I didn\u0026rsquo;t know what I was doing, all I knew was that it made me feel good. Learning made me feel good.\nEverything seemed soo nice and shiny, I wanted to touch them all. I wanted to master them all, trying to spend an hour a day on each tiny subsection of the vast field of computer science, relishing the thought of who I\u0026rsquo;ll become in a year\u0026rsquo;s time. As you can sense, I rather slowly discovered that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work like that. Reality hit me hard. I had nothing to show for the all attention I gave to the various things I involved myself in; Game creation, machine learning, systems development and even web development. I had spread myself so thin. After some years and lots of YouTube videos, I\u0026rsquo;ve realised something important; Curious without structure is Chaos. I was in the chaos.\nSo, What\u0026rsquo;s The Point ?# Well I don\u0026rsquo;t know the point, who does anyway?\nBut if you want to know why I\u0026rsquo;m starting this blog, it\u0026rsquo;s because I want to give myself structure. I want to create that accountability that I didn\u0026rsquo;t have at first, I\u0026rsquo;m doing this for me.\nFast forward from my troubled tech endeavours, I\u0026rsquo;ve found more things I obsess over, as well as more things I need to obsess over. This blog is going to be all about those things.\nSince the sky is the limit, let\u0026rsquo;s soar until it isn\u0026rsquo;t.\n","date":"0001-01-01","id":0,"permalink":"/blog/2026/first/","summary":"As rightly captioned, what\u0026rsquo;s the point ?\nI\u0026rsquo;m currently in my second year of an undergraduate LLB (Bachelor of Laws) degree.
