      <description>&lt;p&gt;As rightly captioned, what&amp;rsquo;s the point ?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m currently in my second year of an undergraduate LLB (Bachelor of Laws) degree. Do I want to be a lawyer, probably not ? What do I want to be ? I don&amp;rsquo;t know.&#xA;All I know is I want to do something big, really big.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always enjoyed the process of learning, teaching myself how to code a while back was the genesis for me. I would become soo engrossed in coding that I would gladly sit behind my computer for 12 hours a day. Now what was I doing?, I don&amp;rsquo;t know. What did I accomplish from that? I don&amp;rsquo;t know. But it changed me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
